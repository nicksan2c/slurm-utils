Various Slurm utilities and plugins.

* sarray
  This script is an attempt at providing the array job concept from PBS in SLURM.
  You can run multiple jobs from a single batch script with the only difference in
  each job being the array index. The array index gives the script a means of changing
  parameters, loading differing data files or anything that requires a unique index.

* srunall
  This script allows a user to have a file with a list of commands to launch as batch jobs
  in the cluster without writing a batch file for each and that these commands don't
  fit well into the array format.

* plugins
  * job_submit.bigmem.lua
    Plugin to enforce minimum memory allocations in the bigmem partition

* misc
  * profile-slurm.sh
    Just a few bash functions I include in my login env to pull out some
    data that isn't directly accessible.

* utils
  * cluster_status.pl
    Displays a table of nodes with cores total and allocated and memory
    allocated and total with overall totals.
